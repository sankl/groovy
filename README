Lightweight groovy launcher 
---------------------------

with ability to bootstrap specified versions of groovy runtime.
Groovy version is specified by GROOVY_VER variable in gr.bat launcher. 

If there is 'lib' directory near the script to execute, the launcher adds to classpath all jars from there.
It's handy to try things not present in maven repositories.

The launcher configures Grapes to be downloaded near itself (handy to port).

Installation
------------

Put somewhere this directory, tune PATH to it, set up JAVA_HOME environment variable to point on JDK

Use
---

$> gr hello_world.gr
